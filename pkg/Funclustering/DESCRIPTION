Description: This package proposes a model-based clustering algorithm for
    multivariate functional data. The parametric mixture model, based on the
    assumption of normality of the principal components resulting from a
    multivariate functional PCA, is estimated by an EM-like algorithm. The main
    advantage of the proposed algorithm is its ability to take into account the
    dependence among curves.
